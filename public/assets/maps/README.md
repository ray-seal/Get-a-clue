# Board Image

The board.svg file is a placeholder mansion floorplan.

To use the actual mansion image from the issue:
1. Replace board.svg with the actual board.png image provided in the issue
2. Update room coordinates in lib/data/room-bounds.ts to match the actual room locations
3. The image should be approximately 1920x1080 pixels for best results
